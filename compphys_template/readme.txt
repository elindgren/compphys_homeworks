Write your report by modifying report.tex.

Please do NOT make changes to anything in the templates_files directory, such as
packages.tex or titlepage.tex. Also, do not do add stuff in report.tex that
alters the layout of the document (such as changing fonts, commonly used
environment styles, margins, etc.) in any way.

The lines appearing in the right margin are there for the teaching assistants to
give you valuable feedback on your solutions.

A printed version of your report should be handed in in the designated cardboard
box before the deadline. Email submissions are not acceptable.

All source code must be included in the Appendix of the report using the
listings package. as in the examples in the template. This increases the
probability that your code will be understood by the teaching assistants, and
thus the chance of getting useful feedback. (Print-outs from your favorite
editor are not acceptable.)

A small check list:

 o The included source code should be well-commented and neatly formatted
   (use indentation) but the report should be understandable on its own!

 o Figures and Tables should be referenced in the text.

 o The Figures need to be presented in a clear way. Do not use tiny font sizes,
   and if you print in black and white, make sure to use different line styles
   if need be.

 o All plot axes should have labels and proper units. (It is not acceptable to
   use 'arbitrary units' everywhere.)

 o All source code must be included in the Appendix of the pdf document.

 o Use appropriate units. (NB: SI-units are NOT always appropriate.)

 o Before the deadline, you must email the source code and the report to the
   teaching assistant in charge of grading the report.

I recommend that you compile the report with XeLaTeX, but any reasonably
new LaTeX flavor and distribution should work.
